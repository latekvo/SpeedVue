 Hello, so over the past four years I've been constantly working on improving my skillset and creating new apps both for backend and frontend. I've been mostly working in a full stack manner recently more on the front, but I still prefer to do a lot of those tasks on the backend. Pretty much each month I try some new technologies, some new project which can expand my skillset. In between making those projects I often meet new people, engineers which often share with me insights and stories of how their jobs look, how does work as an engineer look. An example of one of my latest projects was a data visualization project. I've been mostly working on Node.js, but recently I've been trying some new technologies. This particular project was written in Django and I've only been searching it. It was about gathering out of data from Google Maps, about locations of stores and comparing it to data of population density. It allows me to draw a larger picture of how density of stores compares to population density. I'll also tell you about some area project that I did. This one is pretty much finished. It was a large messenger app and when writing it I had to implement verification plans out of API interactions. So I really see how the whole ecosystem works on both sides, not only in the backend but on the front end as well, which allows me to write better applications since I know what engineers on the other side expect.
