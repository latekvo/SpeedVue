This is kind of a hard question to answer because I'm constantly achieving a new
completing new apps getting new people,
new connections which all I view as a good career points for example.
The past week, I've managed to finish a research app which interacts with app.
I thought about it in the previous interview question.
Um And  I view that as a huge achievement because it taught me a lot of new technologies.
I didn't know about vector databases before about.
This was actually one of my first projects serious projects in Python.
Before I only worked on modifying another project but not writing it from ground up.
The previous project was localising ChatDev which
is an app which allows you to write applications with just a single prompt.
It creates a whole company of AI agents which then
split tasks about a among themselves and complete the whole application in a matter of hours.
And previously, it used the open AI api but right now I changed it to use local models which run on your my machine.
One second, I've got a helicopter outside my window.
And so all of these large projects which I do significantly improve what I can
do with different languages, with apps, I can write.
They contribute to the performance that I've got the skill set.
It may be a controversial view, but I also see the people that I meet as very,
as huge um career achievements. Because with each engineer that I meet,
I learn new things about not only programming itself but about
environment surrounding it.
And yeah, that's about it.
