 Hello, so in the past few years I have a developed contact with Fullstack Tech. I've worked on a lot of apps also in a team, but most often in solo setting. One that I've written most recently that was a full stack up was a messenger with groups, with private conversations. For this certain app I used Angular, a frame stack with Node.js, but lately I've been also writing a lot of, not a lot, I've been writing apps in React, React Native, and I tried other languages for Fullstack, for backend, like Python. With now I was working on a long chain project which uses AI to conduct research, and this required me to do out of interactions with internet, perform searches, operations on databases. It wasn't a typical database because I use vector databases for now. You get a lot of text, split it up into smaller fragments and convert it into embeddings, which are these vectors which represent the whole fragment as a single number or rather a set of numbers. When we later put that into the database, we can easily search for millions of records by just comparing a few numbers, which gives you exact matches without using any search types like a keyword search. This helps, especially when you are not searching for exact words, but rather for meanings. It's an interesting technology. It removes hallucinations from data models, language models, which were a large issue when doing research, and now are not an issue anymore. Going back to more commercial products, I've been working more full stack, more frontend with commercial products added over, where we were developing fuelization monitoring apps. That was my introduction to Angular, to working in a large team in the corporation. I really liked that experience.
