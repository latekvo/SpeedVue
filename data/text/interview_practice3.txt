 Okay, so this story happened recently. I was doing my Invisi Zero Talk qualifications, which are those exams which I have to take at my school. This one was about networking, internet networking, and creating the configuring servers. And I've had issues which weren't supposed to be part of this exam, particularly internet ports which were crucial to the exam, were disabled in BIOS. And I actually had to search through the documentation that I was provided to fix this error, which was not a part of this exam. But around 20 minutes later I managed to fix it. It just took this mindset that there is always a way to fix an issue at hand. And it doesn't really matter if other people don't have this issue. I managed to complete this exam with 100% accuracy, so it didn't matter at the end. But it was definitely a funny experience to talk about later. I could also, perhaps, tell you about an event that happened like two years earlier. That was maybe three years earlier, because that was the first time that I was playing with Linux. I was still installing different versions of it on my computer. And it was remote classes that day. We've had remote classes because of the virus. And so at one point I was doing migrating some files or installing new features, and I accidentally deleted my whole system. And at that moment everything still worked. But when I tried to open new apps or things like that, nothing worked. And this was during one of my classes. So I had to reinstall my whole system during one of the class and not be noticed. That's another funny thing. But after around 20 minutes I think there was no issue. But because of the same mindset that I just told you about.
